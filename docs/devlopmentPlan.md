## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Focus on Functionality First**: Start with minimal UI that works rather than spending time on aesthetics.

2. **Modular Development**: Complete one module before moving to the next; this makes debugging easier.

3. **Continuous Testing**: Test each component as you build it rather than waiting until the end.

4. **Version Control**: Make frequent, small commits with clear descriptions to track progress.

5. **Backend First Approach**: For each feature, implement and test the backend first, then connect the frontend.

6. **Placeholder UI**: Use simple placeholder elements that can be easily replaced with final designs later.
